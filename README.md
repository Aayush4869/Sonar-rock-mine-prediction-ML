# Rock vs. Mine Prediction Model

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify sonar 
returns as either rocks or mines. The goal is to accurately predict whether 
a given sonar return corresponds to a rock or a mine, using various machine 
learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.
